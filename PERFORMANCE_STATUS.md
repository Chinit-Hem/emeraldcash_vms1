## Summary of Changes

### Before (Slow):
```
User clicks "View" → Spinner shows → Waits 2-5 seconds → Sees data
User clicks "edit_file" → Spinner shows → Waits 2-5 seconds → Edits data
User clicks "Delete" → Spinner shows → Waits → Gone
User clicks Dashboard → Spinner shows → Waits → Sees KPIs
```

### After (Fast):
```
User clicks "View" → Cached data shows INSTANT → Background refresh
User clicks "edit_file" → Cached data shows INSTANT → Background refresh
User clicks "Delete" → Gone INSTANT → Background sync
User clicks Dashboard → Cached data shows INSTANT → Background refresh
```

## Key Technical Changes:
1. `localStorage` caching layer for instant data access
2. `isRefreshing` state instead of `loading` state (background only)
3. Optimistic UI updates
4. Background data sync with visual indicators
